# Starts both halves of the Go2 control panel together:
#   1. websocketd, exposing go2_ctrl as a websocket on port 8888
#   2. a plain HTTP server for index.html (+ tb.png) on port 8000
#
# Ctrl+C stops both.
#
# IMPORTANT (same caveat as before): websocketd forks a *new* go2_ctrl
# process per websocket connection and kills it when that connection
# closes. --maxforks=1 caps it at one instance at a time, but reloading
# the browser tab still kills the running process -- taking DDS/FSM state
# with it -- and starts a fresh one. Keep the physical controller within
# reach as your real emergency stop.
